# Casey Craps

**One-liner**: A colorful macOS craps game with synthesized sounds that teaches you how to play craps.

## Problem

Craps is one of the most exciting casino games but also one of the most intimidating to learn. The table layout is confusing, the rules seem complex, and walking up to a real table is overwhelming. This app provides a low-pressure, fun environment to learn the basics of craps before ever stepping foot in a casino.

## Success Criteria

How we know it worked:

- [ ] User can roll dice with satisfying physics and animation
- [ ] Pass line betting works correctly with come-out and point phases
- [ ] Synthesized sounds provide feedback (dice, wins, losses, crowd reactions)
- [ ] Realistic casino table aesthetic with proper layout
- [ ] User understands the basic flow of craps after playing

## Constraints

- macOS native app using SpriteKit (existing Xcode project)
- Synthesized audio only (no bundled sound files)
- Simplified ruleset: Pass/Don't Pass, Come-Out and Point phases
- Single player (no multiplayer or networked play)

## Out of Scope

- Full casino bet types (hardways, props, hop bets, etc.)
- Multiplayer or online play
- iOS/iPad version
- Real money or in-app purchases
- Leaderboards or achievements
- Tutorial mode (learn by playing, not by reading)
